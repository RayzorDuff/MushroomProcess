✅ LOTS BY STATUS — Airtable Interface Extraction

Interface Name: Lots by Status
Captured: November 2025

🧩 DATA CONFIGURATION

Source Table: lots
Title Field: item_id
Visualization Type: Kanban
Grouping Field (Kanban columns): status

Fields displayed in each Kanban card:

item_category (pill-style category label, e.g. lc_syringe, lc_flask, fruiting_block, etc.)

item_name (primary visible title in each card)

regulated (from strain_id) (boolean/tick marker)

strain_species_strain (strain species or sub-strain text)

vendor_name (shown for LC or consumable items)

status (shown as pill label)

inoculated_at, spawned_at, or sterilized_at (contextually displayed based on lot type)

use_by (shown for consumable/retired items)

🧮 GROUPING CONFIGURATION (KANBAN COLUMNS)

The Kanban view groups all records by their status value.
Observed columns and their counts in the capture:

Fridge — 57

ColdShock — 0

Fruiting — 18

Consumed — 74

Retired — 29

Frozen — 0

Each column dynamically lists all lots records with that status, filtered only by user selection (no base filter).

🧠 FILTER CONFIGURATION

Filter: None (All records in table lots are shown).
Users can apply ad-hoc filters through UI since filtering and grouping are enabled in this interface.

🧭 FUNCTIONAL INTENT

The Lots by Status interface provides a kanban-style pipeline visualization for monitoring all lots in production.
Each column represents a production or storage state, and cards within show contextual metadata like strain, item category, and vendor.
Users can:

Drag records between columns to update status directly.

Filter by item_id or strain using the dropdown.

Search or sort dynamically.

This interface acts as a high-level operational dashboard across all categories (grain, LC, plates, fruiting blocks, etc.), making it ideal for supervisors to see progress by stage.
