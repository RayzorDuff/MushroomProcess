✅ PRINT QUEUE — Airtable Interface Extraction

Interface Name: Print Queue
Captured: November 2025

🧩 DATA CONFIGURATION

Source Table: print_queue
Title Field: lot_id
Visualization Type: Kanban
Kanban Group Field: source_kind

Displayed Fields in Each Kanban Card:

lot_id (primary label)

created_at (timestamp)

label_title (from item_id)

label_company (from lot_id)

label_subtitle (from lot_id)

label_upper_line (from lot_id)

label_lower_line (from lot_id)

inoculated_at

sterilized_at

use_by

spawned_at

label_footer (from lot_id)

label_product_line (from lot_id)

This view is optimized for print label batching — every card corresponds to a label job in the queue, grouped by its print source type.

🧮 GROUPING CONFIGURATION (KANBAN COLUMNS)

Group By Field: source_kind

Observed Columns:

Uncategorized — cards without a defined source type (new or misc print jobs)

Grain_Inoculated — labels generated from inoculated grain lots

LC_Flask_Inoculated — labels for LC flasks created or sterilized

Bulk_Created — labels for spawn/bulk substrate production

Product_Package — retail or final product labels

Plate_Inoculated — agar/plate label jobs

Each column represents a print queue category tied to the workflow stage of the originating lot.

🧠 FILTER CONFIGURATION

Filter: None
The entire print queue table is visible by default.

Users can dynamically filter by source_kind (enabled dropdown) and perform ad-hoc filtering/sorting.

🧭 FUNCTIONAL INTENT

The Print Queue interface visualizes active and completed label jobs across all workflow categories.
Each Kanban column represents a print context (e.g., Grain Inoculated vs. LC Flask Inoculated).
Operators can:

Monitor pending labels grouped by stage.

Quickly print by selecting cards.

Review label details (e.g., company, subtitle, inoculation/sterilization dates, use-by).

Add manual print records through the form.

This interface functions as a central production labeling dashboard within MushroomProcess.

🪄 For Retool Interface Guide

The accompanying Retool_Interface_Print_Queue.txt will later describe:

Layout: Kanban view

Primary query:

GET /api/v1/db/data/print_queue?group_by=source_kind


Columns: dynamically generated from unique source_kind values.

Card display template:

{{ lot_id }}
{{ label_title }}
{{ label_company }}
{{ label_subtitle }}
{{ inoculated_at }} – {{ sterilized_at }}
Use By: {{ use_by }}


Actions:

Drag & drop between columns triggers:

PATCH /api/v1/db/data/print_queue/{{record.id}}
{ "source_kind": "{{newColumnName}}" }


Form-based add new print job: POST /api/v1/db/data/print_queue

Filtering: Dropdown control bound to source_kind.

Permissions: Read/Write (for grouping), print/export enabled.

Purpose: Label management, grouping by production source for batch printing workflows.
