Captured: November 2025

🧩 DATA CONFIGURATION

Source Table: lots
Title Field: lot_id

Fields Shown in Record Detail View:

LC Flask Strain (strain_species_strain linked record)

Source Vendor

Inoculated On

Volume Remaining

LC Syringe (linked item_id, category = lc_syringe)

Number of Syringes

🔎 FILTER CONFIGURATION

Filter Conditions:

item_category has any of → lc_flask

status is any of → Inoculated, FullyColonized, Fridge

This filter ensures that only liquid culture flasks that are ready for syringe production or storage display in this interface.

🧮 GROUPING CONFIGURATION

Group By:

regulated (from strain_id) (A → Z)

This provides organization by strain lineage or regulatory grouping field inherited from the linked strain record.

🧠 BUTTON CONFIGURATION
1️⃣ Button: Create Syringes

Type: Update record

Action: Set action = MakeSyringes

Label after: “Updated”

Show check icon: True

Confirmation: False

Source: Record detail

Color: Gray

Visibility Rule: Off

Section: Record header

This triggers internal automations or scripts to convert LC flask lots into syringe inventory, updating action and possibly generating new records in linked tables (e.g., lots with lc_syringe category).

🧭 SUMMARY OF FUNCTIONAL INTENT

The Package Syringes interface serves as a packaging control panel for creating new LC syringe products from liquid culture flasks:

Filters display all active LC flasks ready for syringe extraction (Inoculated / Fully Colonized / Fridge).

Users review strain, volume remaining, and source vendor data.

The Create Syringes button updates the record’s action field to trigger automated syringe production in Airtable or via API.

⚡ MIGRATION BLUEPRINT SUMMARY
🧰 For NocoDB API Script

Equivalent API logic (to be implemented in create_package_syringes_interface.py):

create_view(
    "Package_Syringes",
    source="lots",
    filters=[
        {"item_category": ["lc_flask"], "status": ["Inoculated", "FullyColonized", "Fridge"]}
    ],
    group_by=["regulated_from_strain_id"],
    sort_by=[],
    fields=[
        "strain_species_strain",
        "source_vendor",
        "inoculated_at",
        "volume_remaining",
        "item_id",
        "number_of_syringes",
        "created_at",
        "notes",
        "validation"
    ],
    actions=[{"label": "Create Syringes", "type": "update_record", "set": {"action": "MakeSyringes"}}]
)

🪄 For Retool Guide

The accompanying Retool_Interface_Package_Syringes.txt should describe:

Layout: Two-pane (record list → record detail).

Primary query:

GET /api/v1/db/data/lots?item_category_in=["lc_flask"]&status_in=["Inoculated","FullyColonized","Fridge"]


Button behavior:

PATCH /api/v1/db/data/lots/{{selectedLot.id}}
{
    "action": "MakeSyringes"
}


Group list by strain regulatory linkage (regulated_from_strain_id).

Include read-only view for flask metadata (strain, vendor, inoculation date, volume remaining).
