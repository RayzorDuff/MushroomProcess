🧠 FILTER LOGIC

This interface restricts visible products to active trays that are either freshly filled or currently freezing:

tray_state ∈ { freezer_tray, fresh_tray }


This allows operators to finalize packaging operations or run freeze-dry cycles only for current trays, not archived or completed batches.

🧮 FIELD BEHAVIOR AND PURPOSE

origin_lots → Links back to the harvested or bulk batch source.

species_strain → Carries species name (e.g., “Red Reishi”).

net_weight_g → Input field for raw weight prior to drying.

item_id / package_item → Designate the physical tray or packaging unit.

package_size_g / package_count → Define packaging configuration.

dried_weight_g → Entered post-drying; used for yield calculations.

validation → Internal flag for automation verification or completion state.

ui_error → Captures missing or inconsistent data triggers.

🔘 BUTTON CONFIGURATION
1️⃣ Button: Package

Label: Package

Action: Update record

Record Source: Product Detail

Action Data:

Set action = PackageFreezeDried


Confirmation: None

After Label: “Updated”

Show Check Icon: ✅

Color: Default (Gray)

2️⃣ Button: Freeze Dry

Label: Freeze Dry

Action: Update record

Record Source: Product Detail

Action Data:

Set action = FreezeDry


Confirmation: None

After Label: “Freeze Drying!”

Show Check Icon: ✅

Color: Default (Gray)

These buttons drive automation events that signal transitions in the production pipeline:

PackageFreezeDried: Marks the tray as packaged, triggers label creation, updates inventory.

FreezeDry: Marks tray as drying, links to Freeze Dryer station or equipment queue.

🧭 FUNCTIONAL INTENT

The Package Freeze Dried interface supports the final stage of the mushroom production lifecycle:

Tracks and converts trays of freeze-dried mushrooms into packaged retail units.

Records yield metrics between wet and dried weights.

Provides button-driven automation to mark actions as completed for either Freeze Dry or Package stages.

Filters ensure only active trays (fresh or freezing) appear to prevent double handling.

This view is functionally tied to the earlier Harvest and Print Queue interfaces, acting as the packaging endpoint.

⚡ MIGRATION BLUEPRINT SUMMARY
🧰 For NocoDB API Script

Proposed entry for create_package_freeze_dried_interface.py:

create_view(
    "Package_Freeze_Dried",
    source="products",
    view_type="detail",
    filter={"tray_state": ["freezer_tray", "fresh_tray"]},
    fields=[

🪄 For Retool Interface Guide

A future file Retool_Interface_Package_Freeze_Dried.txt should include:

Layout: Record detail panel, left-hand list of filtered products.

Primary query:

GET /api/v1/db/data/products?where[tray_state]=freezer_tray,fresh_tray


Editable fields:
net_weight_g, package_size_g, package_count, use_by, storage_location, dried_weight_g

Action Buttons:

Package → PATCH request:

PATCH /api/v1/db/data/products/{{record.id}}
{ "action": "PackageFreezeDried" }


Freeze Dry → PATCH request:

PATCH /api/v1/db/data/products/{{record.id}}
{ "action": "FreezeDry" }


Filter: Dropdown toggle for tray state.

Permissions: Read/write, except for origin_lots and species_strain (read-only).

Printing: Enabled for label generation.
