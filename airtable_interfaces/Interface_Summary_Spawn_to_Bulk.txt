🧑‍💻 Intended Behavior

The user selects one or more colonized grain lots (FullyColonized or Fridge) and triggers the Spawn to Bulk action.
This marks the record’s action field as SpawnToBulk, which is caught by your automation scripts (e.g., spawn_to_bulk_create_blocks.js) to generate new substrate lot records and update statuses accordingly.

🧰 Implementation Notes

This interface likely interacts with:

lots (for both source and target lot creation)

items (via linked item_category and strain_species_strain)

events (to record inoculation / bulk spawn actions)

The “Spawn to Bulk” button serves as a state trigger—it does not run a script directly, but updates a record to queue the operation for your automation daemon.

Default view focuses on readiness and grain availability (status + category filtering).

🚀 Data Needed for Automation Script Generation

When creating the NocoDB migration:

Create a lots view filtered as above

Apply grouping and visible columns

Add a custom button (or NocoDB Action API call) to update action: "SpawnToBulk"

The automation handler (spawn_to_bulk_create_blocks.js) will remain functional with minor API endpoint changes.
