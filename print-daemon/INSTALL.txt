Prerequisites:
Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download

Download the portable SumatraPDF.exe and put it in your daemon folder, e.g.:

C:\print-daemon\SumatraPDF.exe

We'll use

pdfkit to render a crisp 4×2 inch PDF (203 dpi printers love vector/PDF)

qrcode to draw the QR (from your public_link)

pdf-to-printer to send the PDF to your JD268BT-CA via the Windows driver

1) Install prerequisites

Open Powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned

# In a fresh folder
npm init -y
npm i axios pdfkit qrcode pdf-to-printer dotenv

Create a .env with your values:

PRINTER_NAME must match the printer name in Control Panel → Printers (or leave it empty to use default).
Ensure you set the printer’s 4×2 paper size as default in Printing Preferences.

2) Node script (print-daemon.js)

Usage

Put a black/white logo.png next to print-daemon.js (optional).

Ensure your Windows printer has 4×2 in stock as default.

Run: node print-daemon.js
Leave it running (or set it up as a Windows service with NSSM).

The script watches Queue_All and prints any rows with print_status = Queued, then marks them Printed (or Error with message).
